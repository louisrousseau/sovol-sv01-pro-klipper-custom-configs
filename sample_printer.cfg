# Stock Sovol Marlin has default speed limits at 500, 500, 5, and 25 mm/s for X, Y, Z, and E respectively.
# Similarly, default acceleration limits are set as 500, 500, 100, and 5000 mm/sÂ² for X, Y, Z, and E respectively.
# Comment says these can be overridden using G-codes M201 and M203, meaning there are effectively no hard-coded,
# immutable limits for speeds or accelerations in the factory firmware, so some values below are going to be 
# somewhat arbitrary.

# SV07 runs 12000 by default, the 25 minute benchy for it 8000
max_velocity: 350
max_accel: 4000
#max_accel_to_decel:5000 # default is max_accel / 2
