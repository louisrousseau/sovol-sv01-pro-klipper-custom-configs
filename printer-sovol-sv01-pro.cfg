# This file contains pin mappings for the stock 2022 Sovol SV01 Pro,
# which uses the GigaDevice GD32F303 based Creality 4.2.2 board.

# To use this config, during "make menuconfig"
# Select the STM32F103
# Check "Disable SWD at startup"
# Bootloader offset (28KiB bootloader)
# Communication interface: Serial (on USART1 PA10/PA9)

# If you're using the touchscreen firmware from https://github.com/fryc88/klipper-sv06plus-screen
# and the https://github.com/gbkwiatt/klipper fork, also set:
# Screen serial interface (USART3 (on PB11/PB10))

# Flash this firmware by copying "out/klipper.bin" to a SD card and
# turning on the printer with the card inserted. The firmware
# filename must end in ".bin" and must not match the last filename
# that was flashed.

# For the [mcu] section you need to use a by-path or a by-id value for the "serial" property.

# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.

# Stock Sovol Marlin has default speed limits at 500, 500, 5, and 25 mm/s for X, Y, Z, and E respectively.
# Similarly, default acceleration limits are set as 500, 500, 100, and 5000 mm/sÂ² for X, Y, Z, and E respectively.
# Comment says these can be overridden using G-codes M201 and M203, meaning there are effectively no hard-coded,
# immutable limits for speeds or accelerations in the factory firmware, so some values below are going to be 
# somewhat arbitrary.
